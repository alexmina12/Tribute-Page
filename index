    <h2> History:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> In 1822, a British naval surveyor noted that Dubai was at that time populated with a thousand people living in an oval-shaped town surrounded by a mud wall, scattered with goats and camels.</li>
        <li> In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai.</li>
        <li> Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 with the British government along with other Trucial States, following the British campaign in 1819 against the Ras Al Khaimah.</li>
        <li> Dubai also – like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892.</li>
        <li> In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate east to Deira.</li>
        <li> In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti – palm fronds.</li>
    </ul>
